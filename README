===============
Templates Admin
===============

Templates Admin is a tiny, nifty application for your Django_ project to edit
your templates, that are stored on your disk, via an admin interface.

Originally this app was inspired by dbtemplates_.

.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.com/
.. _dbtemplates: http://code.google.com/p/django-dbtemplates/

Installation:
=============

1. Put ``templatesadmin`` into your INSTALLED_APPS setting.

2. Add this line to your urlconf but **before** your admin include::

    (r'^admin/templatesadmin/', include('templatesadmin.urls')),

3. Create a group ``TemplateAdmins`` and put all users in there, who should been
   able to edit templates. You don't need to grant any permissions to that group.
   Just call it ``TemplateAdmins``.

   Keep in mind that also Superusers (*is_admin* flag) must belong to this group, if
   they should been able to edit templates. The group name is case-sensitive!

4. Point your webbrowser to ``http://localhost/admin/templatesadmin/`` and start
   editing.

Optional Settings:
==================

There are some settings that you can override in your ``settings.py``:

1. ``TEMPLATESADMIN_GROUP``: The name of your group of your TemplatesAdmin
   Users.

   Default: ``TemplateAdmins``

2. ``TEMPLATESADMIN_VALID_FILE_EXTENSIONS``: A tuple of file-extensions (without
   the leading dot) that are editable by TemplatesAdmin.

   Default::

    TEMPLATESADMIN_VALID_FILE_EXTENSIONS = (
        'html',
        'htm',
        'txt',
        'css',
        'backup'
    )

3. ``TEMPLATESADMIN_TEMPLATE_DIRS``: A tuple of directories you want your users
   to edit, instead of all templates.

   Default: All user-defined and application template-dirs.

4. ``TEMPLATESADMIN_HIDE_READONLY``: A boolean to wether enable or disable
   displaying of read-only templates.

   Default: ``False``

5. ``TEMPLATESADMIN_EDITHOOKS``: A tuple of callables edithooks. Edithooks are
   a way to interact with changes made on a template. Think of a plugin system.

   There are two builtin edithooks:

   - ``dotbackupfiles.DotBackupFilesHook``: Creates a copy of the original file
     before overwriting, naming it ``<oldname>.backup``.
   - ``gitcommit.GitCommitHook``: Commits your templates after saving via git
     version control.
   - ``hgcommit.HgCommitHook``: Creates a `mercurial
     <http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/>`_ commit after saving.

   You can define your own edithooks, see above hooks as example.

   Default::

    TEMPLATESADMIN_EDITHOOKS = (
        'templatesadmin.edithooks.dotbackupfiles.DotBackupFilesHook',
    )
